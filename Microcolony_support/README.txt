During the summer of 2015, I set up the high-throughput microcolony growth assay described in (Levy, 2012) in the Berman Lab at Tel Aviv University. The code for this assay includes bash, MATLAB and R scripts, some of which I rewrote for flexibility, simplicity and readability. I also wrote the following documentation to help members of the lab preform experiments, troubleshoot problems and understand the code.
